TerminusDB is an open-source knowledge graph and document store. It is designed for collaboratively building data-intensive applications and data products. If you want to collaborate with colleagues, build data-intensive applications, if you want a document store where anything can link to anything else, TerminusDB is right for you.

TerminusDB has native revision control, using an approach that is similar to Git and other multi-master distributed version control systems.

TerminusDB provides a RESTful API for interacting via the JSON exchange format. You can easily compose applications within your own toolchain that utilise the powerful features of TerminusDB.

<br/>

TerminusDB is a lightweight, high-speed immutable database. Our [delta-encoding](docs/whitepaper/terminusdb.pdf) approach makes branch, merge, push, pull, clone, time-travel, and other git-like operations possible.

Data collaboration is facilitated through [TerminusX](https://terminusdb.com), which is a managed database cloud service that allows users to access databases and collaboratively work on shared resources.

## Why TerminusDB


* Get started in minutes. Whatever language you're using or if you prefer our low-code console, TerminusDB is easy - you can have your database running in just a few minutes.
* Add, replace and query for documents using a simple RESTful API.
* Powerful query allows you to search for repeating patterns using recursion
* Generate forms, get data validation, and a flexible & surfable document interface (in the console)
* Visual tool to build complex data models, which are easy, maintainable, and enforced
* Data science/data engineering functionality directly in the database and via TerminusX
* Clone the production database, branch, merge, collaboration, lineage, versioning, and time travel - Git-like revision control for large databases
* New paradigm in data-centric application development


## Getting Started

We encourage you to read our [Quick Start](https://docs.terminusdb.com/) guide to better understand how to get started with TerminusDB.

### Building from source

In order to build from the source, follow the [build from source](docs/BUILD.md) directions.

## Client

In order to begin manipulating and querying your database you can
start the TerminusDB server (using the CLI).
You can perform all configuration, querying, and management
functions via the RESTful API. We have a number of client libraries to
help you get started:

The [JavaScript client libraries](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-client) give you
assistance with programmatic access.

The [Python client libraries](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-client-python) allows
you to use a pythonic syntax to query the database.

There are also [examples for CURL](https://docs.terminusdb.com/#/terminusx/curl-reference).

## Documentation

All reference documentation can be found on our [documentation site](https://docs.terminusdb.com/).
